# Backbone TODO app with RhapsodyJS

In this example you can see how the RESTful API for models works, how you can use it with middlewares (in this example I used it to only allow access to the RESTful API via ajax).

You can see that Item and ItemCollection objects used in `app/public/js/main.js` are also generated by RhapsodyJS, and the `toggle` method is defined inside `sharedMethods` in `app/models/Item.js`.

It was also used the recommended way to bootstrap data from server to a page using Backbone, that is using the `reset` method of a Backbone Collection, you can see it in the view `index.ejs`, in `app/controllers/main/views/`.
